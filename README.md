this project includes two main applications one is userlogin system and another is a safe for user passwords

user login system:
brief description about the project :

I used the technologis like :
html and bootstrap for frontend
user and otp models as the database tables
smtblib library for the sending email
sessions for user login

the main objective of this project :
this project enables the user to register the user in the website and verify user account with the otp mail.after the account
verified the user has the functions like signout and changepassword.
I used sessions for userlogin.It enables the user Once user signin in a tab, he is logged in the browser and user is able to login
on any tab directly

a safe for passwords :
this website that saves your passwords for your various accounts on different platforms. To make sure your passwords remain safe on this website, I used an encryption algorithm, which will encode them. the project admin can also see those passwords directly on the site. Password safes are quite useful, and there are multiple tools available from which you can take inspiration to work on this project. 

The user has the functions like store,update passwords on fields of passwords
